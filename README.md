==========
-Begin working on a small form (less than 6cm in its biggest direction). Bring .scad file to class next week. You will have time to work on your forms in class, but printing priority goes to those with finished models.

This is a design of a kidney that is going to be a part of a bigger project. The shape is designed in 3ds max first, then imported to openSCAD to make the hole on top of the kidney.
